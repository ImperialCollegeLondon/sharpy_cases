## Cantilever wing of Aspect Ratio 16 under 1-cos forces

This test case includes the SHARPy scripts for two test cases in [Palacios & Cesnik's book](https://doi.org/10.1017/9781108354868).

Example 7.1: Nonlinear lift on a rigid prismatic cantilever wing
Example 9.1: Gust response of a flexible prismatic cantilever wing.

The same script includes both examples, you just need to switch between rigid/flexible in the settings. The jupyter notebook should be the best starting point, but the file is also saved as a python script as a backup. The output folder and the figure folder include sample results.
